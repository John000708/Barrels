# Barrels
A Slimefun Addon which replicates the popular barrels found in modpacks.

Since this is a Slimefun Addon, you will need to install [Slimefun](https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/TheBusyBiscuit/Slimefun4/master/) and [CS-CoreLib](https://thebusybiscuit.github.io/builds/TheBusyBiscuit/CS-CoreLib/master/) before you can use this Plugin.

## Download: Development Builds
Click on the badge below to go to our "development" build page, where you can download the latest versions before they are released to the public. But keep in mind: These builds are still in development and not guaranteed to work or to be stable.
Release Candidates or "stable" builds will have a proper Version such as "1.1", builds that are still in development will only have a number assigned to them.
